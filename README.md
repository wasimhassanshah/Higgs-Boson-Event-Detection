# Higgs-Boson-Event-Detection
The goal of the project is to classify an event produced in the particle accelerator as background or signal. A background event is explained by the existing theories and previous observations. A signal event, however, indicates a process that cannot be described by previous observations and leads to the potential discovery of a new particle.
